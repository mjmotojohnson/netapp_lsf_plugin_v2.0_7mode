# netapp_lsf_plugin_v2.0_7mode
NetApp 7-mode plugin for LSF
This Git repo is based on an old release named netapp_lsf_plugin_bundle_2013_11_08.

NOTE: this is essentially an obsolete plug in 7-mode and users DFM for monitoring collection.  DFM and 7-mode are no longer supported.  The intention of this project is to retain prior art and to use this code to develop an LSF resource manager for current NetApp products using publicly available API calls.
